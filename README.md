### Introduction ###

This repository contains headers, example code, and (eventually) documentation for anyone who wants to write a BBEdit language module, compiled or otherwise.

For now, if you have any questions, please refer to the [Codeless Language Module document](https://www.barebones.com/support/develop/clm.html) for plist-based modules.

If you would like to write a compiled plug-in (which we recommend, since they're faster and can do more), start by cloning this repo and looking over BBLMInterface.h and the example code. If you have any questions, please [write to Tech Support](mailto:support@barebones.com) and we will be happy to help.
